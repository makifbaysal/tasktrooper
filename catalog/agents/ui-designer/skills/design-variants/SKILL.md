# Design Variants

## Overview

Variants exist so the human can choose a direction with the alternatives in front of them — not to show effort. Two variants that differ only in colour make the human do the designer's job; five variants for a field change waste the review.

**Core principle:** Variants differ in structure, share the design system, are each complete in their own document, and arrive with a recommendation.

## How many

Rule variant-count decides: the number the human names (description, comment or task chat), exactly; otherwise two for a new screen or flow and one for a small change to an existing screen. A design system task has none.

## What makes them different

Pick the one or two axes that matter for THIS screen's main task, and vary those:

| Axis | Variant A | Variant B |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy — what comes first | the summary (totals, what needs attention) | the list itself |
| Layout | single column | master–detail / split view |
| Disclosure | one long page | tabs, or a stepper |
| Density | comfortable rows with secondary lines | a compact table |
| Interaction model | edit inline | edit in a dialog, or on its own page |

Never a variant axis: palette, radius, shadow, icon set, font — those belong to the design system, and all variants use the same one. Copy is the same in every variant except where the structure forces a different label.

## What each variant carries

- Its own self-contained document, titled `design: <screen> · <letter>` — `design: Invoices — list · A`, `design: Invoices — list · B` (screen-mockup-html). The review page lays the documents side by side; one document holding every variant cannot be compared or chosen.
- A name that states the idea, in its `<h1>` and `#notes`: `Variant A — table first`, not `Option 1`.
- One line: the idea, whom it serves best, what it costs (e.g. "needs a new InvoiceSummary organism; the table is reused").
- Both widths and every state (every-state-designed). An incomplete variant cannot be approved, and an approved one with missing states becomes guesswork in the hand-off.

## Recommend one

Say which variant you recommend and why — the brief's primary action, the audience's main task, consistency with the existing screens, and how much it reuses from the inventory — in the recommended document's `#notes` and in your summary comment, naming it by its document title. Then record the choice as ONE non-blocking product question with `record_open_questions`:

```
prompt: "Which variant of the invoice list should be built?"
kind: product, blocking: false
recommended_answer: "design: Invoices — list · A — table first: finance staff scan 50+ invoices a day, and it reuses DataTable as is."
```

## How the choice is read

The human compares the documents side by side on the review page — page by page, commenting on either — and chooses one, which posts a comment whose first line is exactly `Chosen variant: <document title>`. Any lines after it are the human's note on the choice ("keep B's empty state"): act on it like a review comment — a request to take parts of another variant is a combination, so a new variant (see In revision). Read the choice in this order:

1. The latest human comment `Chosen variant: <document title>` — it overrides the question, answered or not.
2. Else the answered variant question.
3. Else, at approval, its recommended answer.

## For a small change

One variant, one document, `design: <screen> · A`, drawn next to what is there today: `Today` and `Proposed` frames side by side at the same width, so the reviewer sees the delta without hunting for it. Draw "today" from the code you read, labelled as such. With one variant there is nothing to choose: no variant question.

## In revision

Once a variant is chosen, revise only its document, keeping its title, sections and ids. The other documents stay on the task as they were — a document cannot be deleted — and the hand-off names the chosen one, so they are never built. `update` or `withdraw` the variant question. A request to combine ("A's table with B's summary") produces one new document with the next letter (`· C`), drawn in full, named for what it is.

## Common Mistakes

- All variants in one document — the human cannot lay them side by side or choose one.
- Two variants that differ only in colour or corner radius.
- A third, half-drawn variant "for inspiration".
- No recommendation — the human is left to guess what you would build.
- Recording the variant choice as a blocking question; there is always a recommended answer.
- Building from the recommended answer when a later `Chosen variant:` comment names another document.

## Red Flags

- A variant missing its 1440 frame or its error state.
- Variant names that say nothing ("Option 1", "Modern").
