description: Use when a mobile app needs a release pipeline - fastlane GitHub Actions to TestFlight (iOS) and Play internal track (Android), with code signing and the release naming that maps to TaskTrooper's prod deploy

# App Store Deploy (mobile)

## Overview

Mobile does not deploy to a cloud you run — it deploys to **Apple's and Google's stores**, so there is no GCP/AWS split. The CD pipeline builds a signed artifact and uploads it to a test track (TestFlight / Play internal), which is the mobile equivalent of a staged deploy. Read [[ci-cd-pipeline-authoring]] for the workflow naming/dispatch contract; this skill fills in the store steps.

**Core principle:** Signing is the hard part, not the upload. Get reproducible, secret-driven signing right and the release is a one-command fastlane lane.

## Set up the pipeline

If the repo has no `fastlane/` yet, create it directly: `Fastfile` lanes `beta` (stage) and `release` (prod, store-executor driven), per the iOS/Android sections below, plus `deploy-stage/preprod/prod.yml` workflow files. There is no `search_boilerplate_catalog` tool in this agent's tool list — don't call it.

## Environment mapping

- `stage` → internal test track: **TestFlight** (iOS) / Play **internal** track (Android).
- `preprod` → **TestFlight external** group / Play **closed** (beta) track.
- `prod` → App Store / Play **production** — the workflow file must still contain `prod`/`production`/`release` so the pipeline's `prod_deploy` check detects it, but nothing dispatches it directly: mobile ships through a `batch` delivery profile. A merged mobile task joins the component's draft release and waits in `done`; a human cuts the release on the Deploy tab, and the release engineer then starts the build (`store` executor) or lets a tag push trigger it (`github_actions` executor — see [[ci-cd-pipeline-authoring]]'s batch section).

## iOS — TestFlight

- Build on a **macOS runner** (`runs-on: macos-26`; `macos-14` is deprecated since 2026-07-06 and unsupported from 2026-11-02, and cannot run Xcode 26, which every App Store Connect upload has needed since 2026-04-28). Select the Xcode version the app needs (≥26) with `xcode-select`/`xcodes`; Xcode 27 needs macOS Tahoe 26.6+ on the runner image.
- Signing via fastlane **match** (certs/profiles in a private git repo, decrypted with `MATCH_PASSWORD`) — never check certificates into the app repo.
- Auth to App Store Connect with an **API key** (`.p8` + key id + issuer id), not an Apple ID password.
- Lane: `fastlane build_app` → `upload_to_testflight`. For prod, submit for review (`fastlane deliver`).

## Android — Play

- Build the **AAB** (`bundleRelease`); sign with the upload keystore from a base64 secret decoded at runtime.
- Auth with a **Play service-account JSON** (`SUPPLY_JSON_KEY_DATA` secret); upload with fastlane `supply(track: 'internal')` (or `production` for prod).
- `targetSdk 36` — required for new apps and updates on Play since 2026-08-31 (existing apps may stay on 35 under the extension window).

## Build numbers

TaskTrooper chooses the build number; the generated `scripts/mobile-release.sh` reads it from `BUILD_NUMBER` and passes it to `xcodebuild` (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`) and Gradle (`-PversionCode`, `-Pandroid.injected.version.code`). Do not add `increment_build_number`, a `latest_testflight_build_number + 1` lane or a `github.run_number` versionCode — two counters fight, and the store rejects the lower one.
- One counter per app, the higher of TaskTrooper's own record and the store's current highest build.
- iOS: `<sequence>.<task number>.<attempt>` (e.g. `412.54.2`) — CFBundleVersion takes up to three integers and TestFlight compares the first one first, so every upload is higher than the last whatever task it belongs to. The project's Info.plist must take `CFBundleVersion` from `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`.
- Android: `versionCode = <sequence>`. A project that hardcodes `versionCode` still gets the number through AGP's injected override.

Per-task test builds: a task entering Human UAT is built from its checkout and uploaded to TestFlight (opened to the internal groups) and to Play internal app sharing (a per-build link, no versionCode ordering). A rejected task that comes back to UAT gets the next attempt number. The "What to Test" note carries the task key, attempt and commit.

## Secrets (these ARE real secrets)

Unlike cloud deploys, mobile signing needs genuine secrets in GitHub `secrets:` — App Store Connect API key, `MATCH_PASSWORD`, keystore + passwords, Play service-account JSON. Store them as encrypted secrets, decode at runtime, never commit or log them. There is no OIDC path for the stores.

## Gate & smoke

The "health check" is the store's own processing/validation. Fail the job if fastlane upload fails or the build is rejected. A successful upload is the store gate passing at `ready_for_qa` time — it still does not move the task anywhere: mobile is a `batch` delivery profile, so a merged mobile task waits in `done`, joined into the component's draft release, until a human cuts it.

## When the store executor ships a cut release

For a `store`-executor batch component, `deploy_release` (called by the release engineer once a human has cut the release) is `storeops.Service.StartBuild` for every platform with a linked app — the same build this skill's stage lane produces, just started directly instead of by this workflow's own trigger. It records the internal-channel build number before starting (`baseline_build`) and the release is verified once the internal channel shows a build other than that baseline (`build`). A platform whose start fails keeps its `error` on the release; the others still proceed.

## Store rules in force (2026-10)

Code-level, this agent can act on these directly:
- **iOS:** build with Xcode 26+; `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` listing required-reason APIs, including ones pulled in by third-party SDKs; an `NS*UsageDescription` string for every permission the app requests (a missing one terminates the app at the request, not a graceful denial); in-app account deletion if the app creates accounts (guideline 5.1.1(v)); a monotonic build number (see above).
- **Android:** `targetSdk 36`; 16 KB-aligned native libraries (keep Flutter/NDK deps current — only matters if the app ships native code); Photo Picker instead of `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` unless media access is the app's core use; declared foreground-service types; an account-deletion path (in-app + web link) if the app creates accounts; a monotonic `versionCode` (see above).
- **Human/metadata, not code:** age-rating questionnaire, EU trader status, Data safety form — list these in the release task for a human, don't attempt them from here.

## Common Mistakes

- Certificates or keystores committed to the app repo instead of match/secrets.
- Using an Apple ID + password instead of an App Store Connect API key → 2FA breaks CI.
- Uploading a debug/unsigned build.
- Bumping to the prod track on a plain branch push — prod is never triggered that way: mobile ships through a `batch` delivery profile, a merged task waits in `done`, and a human cuts the release that then starts the build (see "When the store executor ships a cut release" above).
- Reusing a build/version number across uploads.

## Red Flags

- Signing material in the repo tree or printed in logs.
- A build job on `ubuntu` trying to build iOS (needs macOS).
- Same version/build number reused → store rejects the upload.
